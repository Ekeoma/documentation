# Navigation starts here (order matters)
#
#  - Page keys must be unique, lower case, no spaces.
#  - If page is multi platform add 'platforms: true' to it. (platform sub-folders are expected in this case)
#
#  - Section keys must be unique, lower case, no spaces. Keys map directly to file names (minus .md extension)
#  - If you must use multiple words for keys use a dash '-' as a separator
