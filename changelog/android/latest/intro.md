# Android SDK API Reference

Layer is the open communications layer for the Internet. A global communications infrastructure, exposed through a simple yet powerful SDK. Layer is the building block for rich, secure and reliable messaging, voice and video calls in your application, powered by globally-distributed, reliable infrastructure.

Layer handles the hard parts - sync of messages and message states across devices, offline message support, push notifications and more.

The API reference details the full set of classes used to interact with the Layer SDK. For more information on how to get started with Layer, see the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start/android) guide.
