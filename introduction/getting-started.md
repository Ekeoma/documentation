# Getting started

The Layer SDKs represent the easiest way to add rich communication features to your application. 
They handle the hard parts of messaging including synchronization of messages and message states across devices, offline message support, push notifications and more.

```emphasis
Please note, you have been given access to pre-production version of the Layer service. We do not recommend using the service in production applications at this time. Please contact [The Layer Growth Team](mailto:growth@layer.com) with questions about commercial terms and availability.
```
